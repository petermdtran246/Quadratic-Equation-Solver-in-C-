# Quadratic Equation Solver in C

This program solves the quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 for the coefficients a, b, and c. It calculates the discriminant (d) and determines the nature of the roots based on its value:

  -  Real and Equal Roots: If d is equal to 0, the roots are real and have the same value.
  -  Real and Unequal Roots: If d is greater than 0, the roots are real and distinct.
  -  Imaginary Roots: If d is less than 0, the roots are complex (imaginary).
